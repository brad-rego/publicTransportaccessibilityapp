# publicTransportaccessibilityapp
Public Transport accessibility application(a better name to come later
This is an application inspired by an exprience that I had recently on public transport.
Usually train staff announce what the next stop will be, but recently this has not been happening in my local area. When a blind person came onto my train and didnt know what stop they was at it (and how long till they needed to get off) was quite saddening.So i have decided to attempt to fix this.
